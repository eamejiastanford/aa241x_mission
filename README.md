This package contains the nodes to control the mission for Spring 2019's AA241x.  This README is broken down into the following sections:

 - [Getting Started](#getting-started) - to help with getting you up and running with the mission, how to include the mission in your launch files, and how to set some of the parameters for the mission.

 - [Publishers / Subscribers](#publishers--subscribers) - more detailed explanation of the topic and information the mission publishes and subscribes to.

 - [Services](#services) - detailed explanation of the service provided by the AA241x mission node to provide the landing position in lake lag frame coordinates.

 - [Rules and Equations](#rules-and-equations) - a summary of the rules and equations that define the Spring 2019 AA241x Mission

 - [General Hints](#general-hints) - some additional hints and useful resources for working with ROS and the catkin environment

## Getting Started ##

The following sections will help you get started with the AA241x Mission and using the `aa241x_mission` node and support launch files:
 - [running the mission](#running-the-mission) - how to run the mission node to run the mission related logic as defined in class and [summarized below](#rules-and-equations)

 - [including the mission](#including-the-mission) - how to include the mission launch handling into your own launch files.

 - [communicating with PX4](#communicating-with-px4) - how to start the MavROS node for communication with PX4 on either the Pixhawk 4 or in simulation with gazebo.

### Running the Mission ###

The AA241x Mission management is contained in a single node (at the moment) and can be started either with the `rosrun` command to start just the node, or it can be started with the `mission.launch` launch file using `roslaunch`.

To start the mission with `roslaunch`:

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch aa241x_mission aa241x_mission.launch
```

The mission node has a three parameters that can be adjusted:

 - `mission_index` - specifies which of the [mission files](#mission-files) to load for the given flight.  This parameter is also exposed through the launch file as a launch file argument.  For example, the following example specifies the `mission_index` argument to be `1` using `roslaunch`:

```sh
roslaunch aa241x_mission aa241x_mission.launch mission_index:=1
```

 - `landing_lat` and `landing_lon` - specify the GPS latitude and longitude of the truckbed in decimal degrees.  These two parameters have to both get set in order to be able to query the landing position from the mission node.  These parameters are also explosed through the launch file as launch file arguments and can be specified in the same way as the `mission_index` parameter.  **Note:** see [the section below](#getting-landing-coordinates) for some suggestions for how to get the coordinates of the landing position when you are doing tests yourself.

#### Including the Mission ####

You may find that you will want to create your own custom launch files to launch all the nodes you may need for successfully executing all parts of the AA241x Mission.  The `mission.launch` file can be included in your own launch file by using the `<include>` tag:

```xml
<include file="$(find aa241x_mission)/launch/aa241x_mission.launch" >
    <arg name="mission_index" value="1" />
    <!-- NOTE: these are example coordinates, make sure you specify your desired landing location coordinates! -->
    <arg name="landing_lat" value="37.423767" />
    <arg name="landing_lon" value="-122.177559" />
</include>
```

**Note:** the launch file arguments can also be specified with the `<include>` tag as shown above with the `mission_index`, `landing_lat`, and `landing_lon` arguments being specified to a given value.

### Communicating with PX4 ###

This package contains 2 helper launch files for connection to PX4 with both the Pixhawk 4 hardware and the Gazebo software-in-the-loop simulation.  The details on using and including those launch files are below.

#### MavROS to Pixhawk ####

To launch the MavROS node connected to the physical Pixhawk 4, use the `mavros_pixhawk.launch` file:

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch aa241x_mission mavros_pixhawk.launch
```

Once again, this launch file can be integrated directly into any custom launch files you create with the following include:

```xml
<include file="$(find aa241x_mission)/launch/mavros_pixhawk.launch" />
```

#### MavROS to Gazebo ####

The connection to the software-in-the-loop simulation of PX4 and the Gazebo environment, use the `mavros_gazebo.launch` file:

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch aa241x_mission mavros_gazebo.launch
```

Once again, this launch file can be integrated directly into any custom launch files you create with the following include:

```xml
<include file="$(find aa241x_mission)/launch/mavros_gazebo.launch" />
```

To demonstrate the inclusion of a launch file within another launch file, the package contains an example launch file called `mission_sim.launch` that launches both the mission and the connection to the Gazebo simulation.  It can be run like any other launch file:

```sh
roslaunch aa241x_mission mission_sim.launch
```

     + `n` - the North coordinate of the measurement in [m] in the Lake Lag ENU frame
     + `e` - the East coordinate of the measurement in [m] in the Lake Lag ENU frame

## Services ##

Services are used by the AA241x mission node as ways for you to request specific information from the mission node.  Currently the key service to be aware of is the service to request the Lake Lag frame coordinates of the landing position specified in the launch file as GPS points.

The service is advertised under the topic name: `"lake_lag_landing_loc"`.

To use the service you will need to: 

 1. define a service client as a member variable:

```c++
class MissionNode {
     ...

private:
     ...
     ros::ServiceClient _landing_loc_client;
     ...
};
```


 2. register the service client (recommended to be done in your constructor after your subscribers):

```c++
MissionNode::MissionNode() {
     ...
     _landing_loc_client = _nh.serviceClient<aa241x_mission::RequestLandingPosition>("lake_lag_landing_loc");
     ...
}
```

 3. Request the landing position (recommended to be done just before your `while (ros::ok())` loop):

```c++
int MissionNode::run() {
     ...
     // get the landing position
     aa241x_mission::RequestLandingPosition srv;
     if (_landing_loc_client.call(srv)) {
          // NOTE: saving the landing East and North coordinates to class member variables
          _landing_e = srv.response.east;
          _landing_n = srv.response.north;
          ROS_INFO("landing coordinate: (%0.2f, %0.2f)", _landing_n, _landing_e);
     } else {
          ROS_ERROR("unable to get landing location in Lake Lag frame!");
     }
     ...
     while (ros::ok()) {
          ...
     }
     ...
}
```

**Note:** this has been done for you in the most up to date version of `mission_node.cpp` file in `aa241x_commander`.

## Rules and Equations ##

All the settings and behavior of the mission is outlined in the class presentation and this package merely implements those rules.  Here is a quick recap on some of the more important metric:

### Sensor ###

The "sensor" is simulated by the `aa241x_mission` node.  When the drone is within the given mission area, the node will automatically publish the results of the sensor at the specified rate.  The sensor's performance is defined by the following parameters:

 - **Field of View** - The diameter of the field of view of the sensor is given by the following equation: `diameter = 5/7 * h + 28.57` where `h` is the height above ground as defined by the Lake Lag coordinate frame and is bound by `[30, 100]`.

 - **Rate** - The sensor data is published automatically every 3 seconds (1/3 Hz) to the `measurement` topic and contains the information for all the people in view at the time of the measurement.

 - **Noise** - The sensor will return the position of all the people in view with Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of `sigma = 2 + h/50` meters where `h` is the height above ground as defined by the Lake Lag coordinate frame.


### Bounds ###

The bounds to the mission area are given as follows:

 - the diameter of the allowed mission area is `320 m` centered on `(37.4224444, -122.1760917)` (the origin of the Lake Lag coordinate frame)

 - the maximum allowed altitude is `100 m` and the minimum altitude at which the sensor will operate is `30 m`

 - a violation of either the diameter bound (going outside of the Lake Lag area) or the maximum altitude bound will result in a score of `0`

### Objective ###

Your mission objective is to locate as many people as you can within Lake Lag to better than `1 m` accuracy.  To make an estimate of a person's location, you will publish that estimate to the `person_found` topic which will allow the mission node to score you live (and allow logging of the data for post processing if needed).  **Note:** only the last estimate will be used, so it is important you timestamp the data or else the first estimate will be the one that is used by the mission score calculator.


## Mission Files ##

Each mission is defined by a `.mission` file in the `missions/` directory.  The `.mission` files contain the (North, East) coordinates of each of the people located throughout Lake Lag for a given mission.  The file structure is as follows:
 - each line contains the `North East` location of a single person (with only a single space between the North component and the East component)
 - there can be as many lines as desired
 - there should be no empty lines in the file or any comments in the file
 - positions can be as integers or as decimal values, positive or negative

Each file must begin with `id` and then be followed by a number (e.g. `id1`) that is treated as the mission index number.  This mission index number can be set as a launch file parameter for the mission launch file or a node level argument for the mission node (depending on how you choose to start the mission).


## General Hints ##

### ROS Hints ###

For a more detailed explanation of ROS, the elements of a package, and some of the code elements, check out the [ROS Tutorials page](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) that contains a lot of very useful information (tutorials 2-6, 8, 10, and 11 should be read).  In addition to the tutorials, an effort has been made to comment the code to help explain what some of the elements are doing.


### Catkin Make Hints ###

You may find that you will want to have some custom messages of your own.  If that is the case, make sure to read through [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv) on creating and using custom messages.

### Getting Landing Coordinates ###

There a couple options for doing this:

 1. open Google Maps on your phone and long press on approximately where your blue dot is and that should bring up a pin with the coordinates of your location

 2. **This is the method we will be using:** download an app called `GPS Test` (Android only) and use the latitude/longitude position it specifies with your phone over or next to the landing platform.  The app shows the current error in the position estimate, so feel free to wait a little bit for the error to be a reasonable value (~1-2m).

## Troubleshooting ##

Here are some tips for common problems that you might run into.

### Unable to Connect to Pixhawk ###

Make sure that your user is part of the `dialout` group.  You can check this by typing the command `groups` and ensuring that `dialout` is listed in the group.  If it is node, add yourself to the `dialout` group with the following command:

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G dialout aa241x
```

**Note:** in this case the username is `aa241x`, but if you are working with a different username, make sure to adjust that accordingly.
